# Echoboard

**[EchoBoard](https://app.echoboard.site/home) is a platform designed to address the challenge of effectively sharing and solving problems within the workplace. 
It aims to bridge the gap between employees and upper management by providing a platform for employees to voice their concerns, propose solutions, and collaborate on addressing issues that impact the organisation.**

#

**The Problem**
- Employees often encounter various challenges and obstacles during their work, and they may possess valuable insights and solutions to these problems. However, there is often no organised platform for employees to share their concerns and suggestions, leading to missed opportunities for improvement. Additionally, upper management may lack awareness of the extent of these challenges faced by employees. 
- EchoBoard aims to tackle these issues by providing a platform that facilitates open communication, collaboration, and problem-solving within the organisation.

**The Solution**
- EchoBoard serves as a centralised platform that encourages employees to voice their problems, propose solutions, and collaborate on addressing issues. The core features of the solution include:
	- Problem Visibility: 
		- Employees can upload their problems to the platform, providing visibility to the challenges they encounter in their roles.
	- Voting and Priority: 
		- Other employees can upvote problems to indicate their level of concern, helping to prioritise issues that require attention.
	- Collaboration: 
		- The platform fosters collaboration within and across teams by enabling discussions around the identified problems and potential solutions.
	- Testing Solutions: 
		- Proposed solutions can be voted on and tested by volunteer employees, allowing for practical evaluation and refinement.
	- Solution Labels: 
		- Solutions are categorised with labels such as "being tested," "tested and failed," "tested and succeeded," and "needs volunteers," providing clarity on their status.
	- Problem Resolution: 
		- If a solution is tested successfully, the associated problem is marked as solved and archived for reference.
